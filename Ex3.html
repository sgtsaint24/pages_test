1D7X1 AFSC shreds

The 3D0X4 transition

Previously, the 3D0 and 3D1 career fields were used to describe Air Force members with Cyber Space operations careers, as shown in in table 1. These AFSCs (Air Force Specialty Codes) are now present in the United States Air Force under the 1D7X1 career field, as seen in Table 2.

Table 1

AFSC Identifier	AFSC Title
3D0X1	Knowledge Management
